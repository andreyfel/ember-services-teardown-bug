# ember-services-teardown-bug

This is a bug reproduction repository. Here is the bug:

In ServiceA's `willDestroy` hook we call hi() method of the ServiceB. Until that moment ServiceB hasn't been invoked in any way, so, that call triggered init() of the ServiceB. ServiceB's `willDestroy` hook is not triggered.
In order to see the issue run tests and look at the console.

Expected output:

```
ServiceA init
Hi from ServiceA
ServiceA willDestroy
ServiceB init
Hi from ServiceB
ServiceB willDestroy <---- It never shows up in the console.
```
